# HodgkinHuxely-Spiking
A Model to simulate neuronal spiking based on Hodgkin Huxley model

The Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model, or conductance-based model, is a mathematical model that describes 
how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of nonlinear differential equations 
that approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes.
