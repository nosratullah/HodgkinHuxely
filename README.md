# HodgkinHuxely-Spiking
A Model to simulate neuronal spiking based on Hodgkin Huxley model

The Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model, or conductance-based model, is a mathematical model that describes 
how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of nonlinear differential equations 
that approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes.

# Neuronal Noise
Neuronal noise or neural noise refers to the random intrinsic electrical fluctuations within neuronal networks. These fluctuations are not associated with encoding a response to internal or external stimuli and can be from one to two orders of magnitude.[1] Most noise commonly occurs below a voltage-threshold that is needed for an action potential to occur, but sometimes it can be present in the form of an action potential.
